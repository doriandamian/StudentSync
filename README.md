# StudentSync - Java based OOP project

## Overview

StudentSync is a Java-based School Management System that brings teachers and students together to effortlessly manage and track their scholarly activities. Whether you're a teacher or a student, StudentSync offers a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

## How It Works

### User Authentication

- **Sign In**: New users can register by providing necessary details, specifying if they are a teacher or a student. The program ensures all required fields are filled; otherwise, it prompts for completion.

### Teacher Features

- **Create Classroom**: If you're a teacher without any classes, the app guides you to create a new classroom. Fill in details like "Class name," "Class password," "start date," and "end date."

- **Manage Classes**: Teachers can enter each created class, adding attendances (limited to dates between start and end) and grades (numeric only, with error notification for invalid entries). A messaging feature allows teachers to communicate with the entire class.
